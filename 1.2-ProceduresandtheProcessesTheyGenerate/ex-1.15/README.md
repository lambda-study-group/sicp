The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation `sin x  x if x` is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity

`sin r = 3 * sin * (r / 3) - 4 sin^3 * (r / 3)`

to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered ``sufficiently small'' if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

a.  How many times is the procedure `p` applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated?

b.  What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when `(sine a)` is evaluated?
